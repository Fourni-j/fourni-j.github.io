LaterMark was built for one simple job: make it effortless to save links now and return to them later without losing focus. The app stays out of your way when you are collecting, and helps you quickly decide what to read when you come back.

## The goal
Most read-later tools become another pile. LaterMark is designed to feel calmer and more intentional. The core idea is to separate capture from reading so your saved links stay organized and easy to revisit.

## How LaterMark keeps things simple
LaterMark focuses on a small set of workflows that repeat every day.

- **Save fast** from the iOS Share Sheet, with automatic metadata and a quick title edit.
- **Organize lightly** with tags and collections instead of heavy folders.
- **Decide quickly** with the Discover view (Continue Reading, Up Next, Already Read).
- **Stay in context** with read status and estimated read time.
- **Find anything** using fast search by title or URL.
- **Keep it in sync** across devices with iCloud.

## Feature highlights
Here are the features that do the most work for you day-to-day.

### 1) Save from anywhere
Use the iOS Share Sheet to add a link in seconds. LaterMark grabs the title, site name, and preview so you can move on without extra steps.

### 2) Tags and collections
Tags keep your library flexible, and collections let you group related links for a project, a trip, or a learning track.

### 3) Discover view
Open LaterMark and see what matters next. The Discover tab surfaces links based on your recent activity and read status so you can pick your next read quickly.

### 4) Read status and read time
Track what you have already read and get a time estimate for each link. It makes the choice to read feel lighter.

### 5) Apple Intelligence summaries
When you want the gist without opening the full article, summaries help you decide what is worth your attention.

### 6) Auto classification
LaterMark can automatically suggest tags and collections, so your library stays tidy without manual cleanup.

## Who it is for
LaterMark is for people who save links all day and want a cleaner, calmer place to return to them later. If you like quick capture, smart organization, and a view that helps you decide what to read next, LaterMark is built for you.
