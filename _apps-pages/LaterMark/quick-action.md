LaterMark makes it easy to save links from Safari, apps, or anywhere on your iPhone using the iOS Share Sheet. It is the fastest way to capture something when you are browsing.

## How the Share Sheet works
When you find a link you want to save, tap the Share button in Safari or any app, then select LaterMark from the Share Sheet. The link is instantly saved with its title, site name, and preview—no extra steps required.

## How to save a link via the Share Sheet
1. **Open Safari or any app** with a link you want to save.
2. **Tap the Share button** (the square with an arrow pointing up).
3. **Scroll through the Share Sheet** and tap the **LaterMark** icon.
4. **Confirm or edit the title** if needed, then save.

The link is now in your LaterMark library, ready to read later.

## How to make LaterMark appear in the Share Sheet
If you do not see LaterMark in the Share Sheet after installing, you may need to enable it manually.

1. **Open LaterMark at least once** after installing it. (This registers the app with iOS.)
2. **Open Safari or any app** and navigate to a webpage or link.
3. **Tap the Share button** to open the Share Sheet.
4. **Scroll to the end** of the app icons in the Share Sheet.
5. **Tap "Edit Actions…"** or **"More"** (the wording depends on your iOS version).
6. **Find LaterMark** in the list and toggle it on, or drag it to your favorites.
7. **Tap Done** to save your changes.

LaterMark will now appear in the Share Sheet whenever you share a URL.

## Troubleshooting: If LaterMark does not appear
If you still do not see LaterMark in the Share Sheet, try these steps:

- **Make sure you opened the app at least once.** iOS needs to register the Share Extension before it appears.
- **Ensure you are sharing a URL.** LaterMark only appears when you share a web link or page. It will not show up when sharing photos, files, or other content.
- **Check your iOS version.** The Share Sheet layout changed in iOS 13 and later. On older versions, look for "More" at the end of the app row. On newer versions, scroll to the end and tap "Edit Actions…".
- **Scroll all the way to the end.** Sometimes new apps appear at the far right of the Share Sheet.
- **Restart your device.** iOS can take a moment to register new Share Extensions, especially after a fresh install or update.
- **Reinstall LaterMark if needed.** In rare cases, reinstalling the app can help iOS refresh the Share Extension registration.

## Pro tip
Once LaterMark is enabled, you can drag it to the front of your Share Sheet favorites so it is always easy to find. This makes saving links even faster when you are on the go.
