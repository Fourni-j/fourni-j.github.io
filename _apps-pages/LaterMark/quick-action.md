LaterMark includes a Home Screen Quick Action so you can save a link without opening the full app. It is the fastest way to capture something when you are on the move.

## What the Quick Action does
The Quick Action opens a small save flow where you can paste a URL and store it immediately. It is perfect for those moments when you already have the link copied and just want it saved.

## How to access the Quick Action
1. **Open LaterMark once** after installing it. (This allows iOS to register the Quick Action.)
2. **Long-press the LaterMark icon** on your Home Screen or in the App Library.
3. **Tap the LaterMark Quick Action** in the menu that appears.
4. **Paste the link** and confirm the save.

## If you do not see the Quick Action
- Make sure the app has been opened at least once.
- Wait a moment after installing or updating; iOS can take a few seconds to refresh the menu.
- Restart your device if the menu still does not show the action.

## Pro tip
If you use LaterMark often, keep the app on your Home Screen so the Quick Action is always one long-press away.
