## Introduction

Welcome to the SketchArt App ("app", "we", "our", or "us"). By downloading, accessing, or using our app, you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using the app.

## Acceptance of Terms

By using our app, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms. We may modify these terms at any time, and such modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the modified terms within the app or on our website. Your continued use of the app signifies your acceptance of the updated terms.

## Use of the App

This app is designed to generate pictures from drawing for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to misuse the app or use it for any illegal or unauthorized purposes.

## Subscription & Payments

While the basic version of the app is free, additional features and customization options can be unlocked through a subscription model. All payments, subscriptions, and related transactions are handled by the Apple App Store, not by us. 

## Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to our app for any reason, including breaches of these terms. If you wish to terminate your account or usage, simply uninstall the app from your device.

## Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from or relating to the use or inability to use the app.

## Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated terms within the app or on our official channels. Your continued use of the app after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
